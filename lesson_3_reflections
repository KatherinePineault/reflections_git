When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	A remote repository could be used if I'm working from multiple computers (working from home and committing changes from my personal computer) 
	or when working collaboratively with other people. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    	Pulling changes manually lets you work on different versions of code without overwriting them before you are ready. There are probably other uses
	that I can't think of at the moment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Forks are only used to 'clone' a github repository to your github account. That would be useful when you want to modify a repository already existing on 
	github, but not for the purpose of submitting the changes to the existing repository. 

	Clones can be done from github to a local repository, or from two local repositories. It's an equivalent to copy-paste for a repo. 

	Branches are used to create another version of the code within the same repository.They can be used on a local repo or on a github repo, and they servec
	to track changes made to an original code in a parallel version of the code. Eventually, the branch *can* be merged into the master branch if the changes 
	are useful to be added. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	It gives you the ability to either fast-forward merge or merge the changes made locally to the remote version, and process to resolve the merge 
	conflicts, may they appear.

   

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

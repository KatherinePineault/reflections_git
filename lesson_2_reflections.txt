What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, it creates a hidden file .git that will track the changes in the folder. It needs to be done to start tracking files. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a non-permanent space to add files to before commiting them to the repository. It offers the possibility to think (and make mistakes & fix them) about how to organise a commit around a logical unit.
